//! The mesh and the collection lattice, on fixtures that carry the absences.
//!
//! This exists for two reasons that unit tests cannot cover.
//!
//! **It is the absence fixture.** Non-resident descriptors, declared-but-never-
//! performed derivations and members reached only as somebody else's join input
//! are the point of the lattice view, and none of them has ever been seen on
//! live data — every pile we own reports "0 with no resident descriptor". A
//! clean render must not be allowed to imply the path works, so the path is
//! exercised here, deliberately, on data that is labelled as invented.
//!
//! **It renders.** The tests drive `egui` headlessly and ask the painter what
//! shapes came out, which is the right question for a settling layout — it has
//! no pixel identity to compare against, and pretending otherwise would be the
//! determinism this design rejects. But shape kinds are not a picture. This
//! notebook is the picture, and `--headless` turns it into PNGs.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run --release --example graph_views -- --headless --out-dir /tmp/graph_views
//! ```
