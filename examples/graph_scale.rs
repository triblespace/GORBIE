//! Time the CPU force layout at the sizes the three views actually reach.
//!
//! This exists because the decision it feeds is otherwise made by instinct:
//! whether a GPU is warranted for a given view, or whether reaching for one is
//! laziness dressed as ambition. Run it, read the numbers, then decide.
//!
//! Every figure it prints is **milliseconds per solver step**, single core,
//! release build, on the named machine — not per frame, and not per token of
//! anything. A step is one force evaluation plus one integration plus the two
//! momentum corrections. A view that wants 4 ms of solver per frame gets
//! `4 / <figure>` steps of settling per frame at that size.
