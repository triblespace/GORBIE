//! Pan, zoom, fit and culling for a world-space graph drawn into a rect.
//!
//! The interaction handling is lifted from the wiki viewer, including two
//! details that look like noise and are not:
//!
//! * The hover check is `rect.contains(pointer)` directly, not
//!   `response.hovered()`. Inside a notebook's `ScrollArea` the scroll area
//!   claims hover priority, `hovered()` returns false, and wheel events fall
//!   through to the page instead of the graph.
//! * Only the scroll delta actually *used* is consumed. Zooming on horizontal
//!   drift caught trackpad sideways motion on every scroll and zoomed the graph
//!   when the reader only wanted to scroll the page.
//!
//! `fit` is new, and it fixes something the lifted viewer had wrong: it seeded
//! a ring of radius `200 + 5n`, which at its live size is 17,110 world units
//! against a 7,680-unit visible half-width at the zoom floor, so the graph
//! opened entirely off-screen and the reader had to find it by dragging.
