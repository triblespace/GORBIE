//! The two index structures the force law needs, and nothing else.
//!
//! Both exist for the same reason: the lifted kernel computed every force by
//! scanning everything. Repulsion scanned all `n` other nodes; attraction
//! scanned all `e` edges looking for the ones touching `i`. That is `n² + n·e`
//! per step, which is fine at the few hundred nodes the wiki had and is
//! `1.6e9` operations per step at the sizes this module now has to reach.
//!
//! Neither structure changes the force being computed. [`Csr`] is a
//! reindexing of the same edge sum — every term that was found by scanning is
//! still there, found by lookup instead. [`QuadTree`] is exact when `theta` is
//! zero (the acceptance test can never fire, so every leaf is visited) and
//! approximates only the *far* field above it.

/// Adjacency in compressed-sparse-row form, plus the degree vector the
/// symmetric attraction weight needs.
///
/// Edges are stored twice — once from each endpoint — because the force is
/// symmetric and both endpoints need to find it. Out-of-range and self-edges
/// are dropped at build time rather than checked per step: a view over an open
/// world may name an endpoint it did not include, and skipping such a record is
