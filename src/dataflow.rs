/// written inline in a card is a derivation performed at frame rate. For work
/// measured in seconds that is what `ComputedState` is for; for work measured
/// in milliseconds a background thread is the wrong answer, because a card that
/// shows last frame's figures for a derivation costing one millisecond is worse
/// than one that simply computes it. This is the middle case, and in practice
/// it is the common one.
///
/// The key is the whole of the contract. It must name *every* input the
/// computation reads, because nothing here can detect an input it was not told
/// about, and a stale figure is indistinguishable from a fresh one at the point
/// it is read. Prefer a key that recomputes too often to one that might not
/// recompute at all.
///
/// [`get`](Self::get) hands the key back to the closure, and the closure should
/// read its inputs from *there* rather than from the owner it happens to be
/// written inside. Be precise about what that buys. It does **not** make an
/// incomplete key impossible: only a genuinely non-capturing `fn(&K) -> T`
/// would do that, and one cannot be used here, because the key is compared on
/// every frame and so must be cheap to compare — which forces it to hold
/// *representatives*, a snapshot revision standing for twenty-three million
/// facts, rather than the inputs themselves. Requiring the key to contain every
/// input would cost the cheap comparison that is the memo's whole purpose. It
/// is a tradeoff, not an impossibility.
///
/// What it does kill is divergence: the key says `filter` is A while the
/// closure reads `self.filter`, which is B. A card body has `self` in scope
/// with every field on it, so that trap is a real one. With `&key` in hand the
/// natural thing to write is `key.filter`, and the two cannot disagree.
///
/// ```ignore
/// // In a card body, where `self` is the viewer holding the state. `book` is
/// // pulled out first so the closure borrows one field rather than all of
/// // `self`; it is not in the key because the revision stands for it.
/// let book = &self.book;
/// let rows = self
///     .by_customer
///     .get((revision, filter.clone()), |key| book.revenue(&key.1));
/// for row in rows.iter() { /* ... */ }

/// recomputation, not a hit. A map would keep figures alive against a model
/// that can run to gigabytes, for keys nobody is looking at.
