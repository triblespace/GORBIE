/// force-directed layout would discard exactly the structure that matters. The
/// first two are still true and the third is the part that has been fixed
/// rather than abandoned: **the ranking did not go away, it became a force.**
/// A node's rank is still its longest path from a minimal element, computed by
/// exactly the same [`levels`] function, and it is now a stiff spring pinning
/// the node's `x`. A source is still always to the left of everything it feeds.
///
/// What the simulation buys is the `y` axis, which the old layout had to guess
/// at by stacking siblings in index order. Left free, `y` is available to carry
/// something real: a cross-collection derivation edge is an ordinary spring,
/// and because `x` is pinned it can only pull in `y` — so a member and the
/// member it was derived into line up, and a member with no partner visibly
/// fails to. That is the derive backlog drawn instead of counted, and it is not
/// available to a layout that has already spent `y` on index order.
///
/// It also buys size. The old placement compressed a column to fit the
/// allocated height, so a collection with twenty thousand members drew twenty
/// thousand marks inside a few hundred points; a pan-and-zoom viewport over a
/// settling layout draws the same members at a size a reader can use.
///
/// # Encoding
///
/// Facts, each in its own channel, none of them colour alone:
///
/// * **Shape** — square is authored, circle is computed, and a circle with a
///   gap at the bottom is an element nothing here produced.
/// * **Stroke** — solid is resident and vouched for, an open outline is
///   resident with no proof admitting the record that put it here, dashed is a
///   hole. The three are ordered by how much of the element we actually have.
///   Dashed edges are equations the model expects and no record endorses.
/// * **Arc** — the track around a mark is materialized work over expected
///   work. An empty track is no evidence, not agreement.
/// * **Position** — rank is horizontal, and vertical alignment across lanes is
///   correspondence.
/// * **Motion** — energy is granted only where something changed.
///
/// Hue is a fourth channel and never the only one. It restates admission —
/// [`themes::admitted_mark`] against [`themes::unadmitted_mark`], the widest
/// colourblind-safe separation in the palette — and in doing so it separates
/// admitted from unknown, which nothing else does. That is allowed precisely
/// because it is the one distinction here nobody acts on; the distinction that
/// *is* actionable, a member waiting on a grant, rides on the stroke.
///
/// The accent is spent on one thing only: the ring around the selected node.
/// It is the same value as [`themes::unadmitted_mark`], which is why an
/// unadmitted mark is never told apart from a selected one by colour: one is a
/// mark, the other a ring at the track radius.
///
/// # Selection
///
/// Passing `selected` dims everything that is not on that node's chain, so a
/// derived collection can be walked back to the sources it was computed from.
/// The chain is the transitive closure in **both** directions: every element
/// that feeds the selection and everything the selection feeds. Unendorsed
